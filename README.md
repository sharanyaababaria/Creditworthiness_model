# Creditworthiness_model
## Data Cleaning and Preparation:
### Processed the dataset by identifying and handling missing values.
### Treated outliers to enhance model performance, assessing the impact of these treatments on accuracy and recall.
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
### Conducted data visualization and correlation analysis to understand feature interactions.
### Identified key features that significantly impact creditworthiness, supporting feature selection for model refinement.
## Modeling and Evaluation:
### Implemented and compared multiple models: Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression.
### Evaluated models based on accuracy, recall, and F1 scores, selecting Logistic Regression as the most effective model.
## Clustering Analysis:
### Used K-Means clustering to segment applicants, assessing the quality of clustering with silhouette scores for robust segmentation insights.
## Feature Selection and Recommendations:
### Highlighted features with the strongest influence on creditworthiness, recommending removal of less impactful variables to streamline the model.
